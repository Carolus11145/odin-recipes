        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion, bell peppers and garlic;
                cook and stir until the vegetables have softened and the onion has turned translucent.
                This should be about 5 minutes. 
            </li>
            <li>Take a bowl and mix together the tomatoes, cumin, paprika, salt and chili pepper. Pour the mixture into the skillet
                to combine it with the vegetable mix.
            </li>
            <li>Simmer the mixture uncovered for around 10 minutes until the juices have cooked off.</li>
            <li>Create four openings in the mix and crack the eggs into them. Let the eggs cook for about 5 minutes
                (or a bit longer if you'd like the yolk slightly dryer).
            </li>
            <li>If you've followed the recipe correctly, you're dish should look like the image above (more or less).
                If so, well done! You may now dine on your delicious Chakchouka.
